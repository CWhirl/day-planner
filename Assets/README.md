# day-planner
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

Upon startup, init will retrieve the time and color code the timeblocks to show which tense they are in. Then the init function will attempt to load any events from local storage. 
The user then enters their TODO items into inputs in a table, and then clicks the corresponding save button to save the item to local storage so that they will be there the next time
they open the page.
